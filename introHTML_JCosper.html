<title>Welcome to John Cosper's website</title>

<body>Hello!  My name is John.  I have been an IT professional for over 25 years.   I first learned web design in 2007 at Truck Meadows Community College in Reno, NV, before HTML5.   Following that I took advanced web design using PHP, JavaScript, and an ASP.NET grad course at University of Nevada.   I really have not coded in HTML for a long time because the websites I work with use content management systems like Joomla or Wordpress.   I support enterprise web applications but that does not involve HTML either.   My expectation for this course is to relearn what I have forgotten and add new knowledge about HTML5.   I also want to restore confidence using CSS.   My favorite hobby is walking.   I try to walk up to 2 hours per day.   It is an easy way to stay fit.   I also just enjoy refreshing my IT skills because I frequently forget what I used to know.
