				<!--About Me Statement-->
		<p>Hello, my name is John.  I am an IT Professional with over 25 years of experience.   I started as an order entry clerk uploading data to a mainframe.  I worked as a mainframe operator for seven years.   I studied computers, servers, and networking during the 1990’s and became an IT technician.  Next, I learned about databases and programming.  Since 2013 I have traveled around the United States conducting Maximo administration, development, business analysis, business intelligence, and integrations.   </p>
		<!-- Education Overview -->
		<p>I graduated from California State University, Sacramento in 2003 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting Information Systems; a concentration in the Business Administration program.   I completed coursework in Networking, Programming, Database Management, Web Design, Project Management, Business Analysis, Software Integrations, IT Management, and IT Security, and Enterprise Software Configuration using SAP ERP.   I have been a graduate student in Information Technology programs at University of Nevada, Central Michigan University, and Georgetown University.   My focus now at the University of Missouri is a Master of Science Degree in Learning Technology and Design, specializing in Online Education.   I should graduate in the Spring of 2022.   Besides attending higher education I have completed certifications for Microsoft Certified Professional, Comptia A+, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and Project Management from UC Berkeley.  I’m motivated by lifelong learning and to inspire others to do the same.
